<h2 id="background"><a class="header" href="#background">Background</a></h2>
<p>Memory consists of a large array of bytes, each with its own address. The CPU
fetches instructions from memory according to the value of the program counter.
These instructions may cause additional loading from and storing to specific memory
addresses.</p>
<p>A typical instruction-execution cycle:</p>
<ol>
<li>First fetches an instruction from memory. </li>
<li>The instruction is then decoded and may cause operands to be fetched from 
memory addresses.</li>
<li>After the instruction has been executed on the operands, results may be stored 
back into memory.</li>
</ol>
<p>The memory unit sees only a stream of memory addresses; it does not know how 
they are generated or what they are for.</p>
<p>Main memory and the registers built into each processing core are the only general-purpose
storage that the CPU can access directly. Ther eare machin instructions that take
memory addresses as arguments, but none that take disk addresses. Therefore, any
instructions in execution, and any data being used by the instructions, must be 
in one of these direct-access storage devices. If the data are not in memory, they
must be moved there before the CPU can operate on them.</p>
<p>Registers that are built into each CPU core are generally accessible within one
cycle of the CPU clock. Some CPU cores can decode instructions and perform simple
operations on register contents at the rate of one or more operations per clock 
tick. The same cannot be said of main memory, which is accessed via a transaction 
on the memory bus. Completing a memory access may take many cycles of the CPU clock.
In such cases, the processor normally needs to stall, since it does not have the
data required to complete the instruction that it is executing. This situation
is intolerable because of the frequency of memory accesses. The remedy is to add
fast memory (cache) between the CPU and main memory, typically on the CPU chip 
for fast access. To manage a cache built into the CPU, the hardware automatically
speeds up memory access without any operating-system control.</p>
<p>For proper system operation, we must protect the operating system from access by
user processes, as well as protect user processes from one another. This protection
must be provided by the hardware, because the operating system doesn't usually 
intervene between the CPU and its memory accesses (because of the resulting performance
penalty).</p>
<h2 id="base-and-limit-registers"><a class="header" href="#base-and-limit-registers">Base and Limit Registers</a></h2>
<p>We first need to make sure that each process has a separate memory space. Separate 
per-process memory space protects the processes from each other and is fundamental 
to having multiple processes loaded in memory for concurrent execution. To separate 
memory spaces, we need the ability to determine the range of legal addresses that 
the process may access and to ensure that the process can access only these legal 
addresses. We can provide this protection by using two registers, usually a base 
and a limit.</p>
<p><img src="../media/base-and-limit-register.png" alt="Figure: A base and a limit register define a logical address space." /><br />
<strong>Figure: A base and a limit register define a logical address space.</strong></p>
<p>The base register holds the smallest legal physical memory address; the limit 
register specifies the size of the range. For example, if the base register holds 
300040 and the limit register is 120900, then the program can legally access all 
addresses from 300040 through 420939 (inclusive).</p>
<p>Protection of memory space is accomplished by having the CPU hardware compare
every address generated in user mode with the registers. Any attempt by a program
executing in user mode to access operating-system memory or other users' memory
results in a trap to the operating system, which treats the attempt as a fatal 
error. This scheme prevents a user program from (accidentally or deliberately) 
modifying the code or data structures of either the operating system or other users.</p>

<h2 id="address-binding"><a class="header" href="#address-binding">Address Binding</a></h2>
<p>Usually, a program resides on a disk as a binary executable file. To run, the program
must be brought into memory and placed within the context of a process, where it
becomes eligible for execution on an available CPU. As the process executes, it
access instructions and data from memory. Eventually, the process terminates, and
its memory is reclaimed for use by other processes.</p>
<p>Most systems allow a user process to reside in any part of the physical memory.
Thus, although the address space of the computer may start at 00000, the first
address of the user process need not be 00000. In most cases, a user program goes
through several steps - some of which may be optional - before being executed.
Addresses may be represented in different ways during these steps. Addresses
in the source program are generally symbolic (such as the variable <code>count</code>). A 
compiler typically binds these symbolic address to relocatable addresses (such 
as &quot;14 bytes from the beginning of this module&quot;). The linker or loader in turn
binds the relocatable addresses to absolute addresses (such as 74014). Each binding
is a mapping from one address space to another.</p>
<p><img src="../media/compiling-diagram.png" alt="Figure: Multistep processing of a user program." />
<strong>Figure: Multistep processing of a user program.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compile time</strong>: If you know at compile time where the process will reside in
memory, then absolute code can be generated. For example, if you know that a user 
process will reside starting at location \(R\), then the generated compiler code 
will start at that location and extend up from there. If, at some later time, 
the starting location changes, then it will be necessary to recompile this code.</li>
<li><strong>Load time</strong>: If it is not known at compile time where the process wil reside
in memory, then the compiler must generate relocatable code. In this case, final
binding is delayed until load time. If the starting address changes, we need only
reload the user code to incorporate this changed value.</li>
<li><strong>Execution time</strong>: If the process can be moved during its execution from one
memory segment to another, then binding must be delayed until run time. Special
hardware must be avaiable for this scheme to work.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="logical-vs-physical-address-space"><a class="header" href="#logical-vs-physical-address-space">Logical vs. Physical Address Space</a></h2>
<p>An address generated by the CPU is commonly referred to as a logical address,
whereas an address seen by the memory unit - that is, the one loaded into the 
memory-address register of the memory - is commonly referred to as a physical
address.</p>
<p>Binding addresses at either compile or load time generates identical logical
and physical addresses. However, the execution-time address-binding scheme results
in differing logical and physical addresses. In this case, we usually refer to
the logical address as a virtual address. The set of logical address generated
by a program is a logical address space. The set of physical addresses corresponding
to these logical addresses is a physical address space. Thus, in the execution-time
address-binding scheme, the logical and physical address spaces differ.</p>
<h2 id="memory-management-unit-mmu"><a class="header" href="#memory-management-unit-mmu">Memory Management Unit (MMU)</a></h2>
<p>THe run-time mapping from virtual to physical addresses is done by a hardware
device called the memory-management unit (MMU). We can choose from many different
methods to accomplish such mapping. </p>
<p>Consider a simple scheme where the value in the relocation register (the base register) 
is added to every address generated by a user process at the time it is sent to 
memory. For example, if the base is at 14000, then an attempt by the user to 
address location 0 is dynamically relocated to location 14000; an access to location 
346 is mapped to location 14346.</p>
<p>The user program never accesses the real physical addresses. The program can 
create a pointer to location 346, store it in memory, manipulate it, and compare 
it with other addresses all as the number 346. Only when it is used as a memory 
address (in an indirect load or store, perhaps) is it relocated relative to the 
base register. The user program deals with logical addresses. The final location
of a referenced memory address is not determined until the reference is made.</p>
<h2 id="dynamic-linking"><a class="header" href="#dynamic-linking">Dynamic Linking</a></h2>
<p>So far, it has been necessary for the entire program and all data of a process 
to be in physical memory for the process to execute. The size of a process has 
thus been limited to the size of physical memory. To obtain better memory-space 
utilization, we can use dynamic loading. With dynamic loading, a routine is not
loaded until it is called. All routines are kept on disk in a relocatable load
format. The main program is loaded into memory and is executed. When a routine 
needs to call another routine, the calling routine first checks to see whether 
the other routine has been loaded. If it has not, the relocatable linking loader
is called to load the desired routine into memory and to update the programs'
address tables to reflect this change. Then control is passed to the newly loaded
routine. Dynamic loading does not require any special support from the operating
system. It is the responisiblity of the user to design their programs to take 
advantage of such a method. Operating systems may however help the programmer
by providing library routines to implement dynamic loading.</p>
<p>Dynamically linked libraries (DLLs) are system libraries that are linked to user
programs when the programs are run. Some operating systems support only static
linking, in which system libraries are treated like any other object module and
are combined by the loader into the binary program image. Dynamic linking, in 
contrast, is similar to dynamic loading. Here, though, linking, rather than loading,
is postponed until execution time. A second advantage of DLLs is that these libraries
can be shared among multiple processes, so that only one instance of the DLL is 
in main memory. For this reason, DLLs are also known as shared libraries.</p>
<p>Unlike dynamic loading, dynamic linking and shared libraries generally require
help from the operating system. If the processes in memory are protected from
one another, then the operating system is the only entity that can check to see
whether the needed routine is in another process's memory space or that can allow
multiple processes to access the same memory addresses.</p>
<h2 id="contiguous-allocation"><a class="header" href="#contiguous-allocation">Contiguous Allocation</a></h2>
<p>The main memory must accommodate both the operating system and the various user 
procces. We therefore need to allocate main memory in the most efficient way
possible. The main memory is usually divided into two partitions: one for the
operating system and one for the user processes. We can place the operating system
in either low memory addresses or high memory addresses. This decision depends 
on many factors, such as the location of the interrupt vector. However, many operating
systems place the operating system in high memory.</p>
<p>We usually want several user processes to reside in memory at the same time. We 
therefore need to consider how to allocate available memory to the processes that 
are waiting to be brought into memory. In contiguous memory allocation, each 
process is contained in a single section of memory that is contiguous to the section 
containing the next process.</p>
<p>We can prevent a process from accessing memory that it does not own by combining
two ideas previously discussed. If we have a system with a relocation register,
together with a limit register, we accomplish our goal. The relocation register
contains the value of the smallest physical address; the limit register contains
the range of logical addresses. The MMU maps the logical address dynamically by
adding the value in the relocation register. This mapped address is sent to memory.</p>

<strong>Figure: Hardware support for relocation and limit registers.</strong></p>
<p>When the CPU scheduler selects a process for execution, the dispatcher loads the 
relocation and limit registers with the correct values as part of the context 
switch. Because every address generated by a CPU is checked against these registers, 
we can protect both the operating system and the other users’ programs and data 
from being modified by this running process.</p>
<p>One of the simplest methods of allocating memory is to assign processes to variably
sized partitions in memory, where each partition may contain exactly one process.
In this variable-partition shecme, the operating system keeps a table indicating
which parts of memory are available and which are occupied. Initially, all memory
is available for user processes and is considered one large block of available
memory, a hole. Memory contains a set of holes of various sizes.</p>
<p><img src="../media/variable-partition.png" alt="Figure: Variable partition." /><br />
<strong>Figure: Variable partition.</strong></p>
<p>Initially, the memory is fully utilised, containing processes 5, 8, and 2.
After process 8 leaves, there is one contiguous hole. Later on, process 9
arrives and is allocated memory. Then process 5 departs, resulting in two non-contiguous
holes.</p>
<p>As processes enter the system, the operating system takes into account the memory
requirements of each process and the amount of availabe memory space in determining
which processes are allocated memory. When a process is allocated space, it is
loaded into memory, where it can then compete for CPU time. When a process terminates,
it releases its memory, which the operating system may then provide to another 
process.</p>
<p>In general, the memory blocks available comprise a set of holes of various sizes
scattered throughout memory. When a process arrives and needs memory, the system
searches the set for a hole that is large enough for this process. If the hole 
is too large, it is split into two parts. One part is allocated for the arriving
process; the other is returned to the set of holes. When a process terminates,
it releases its block of memory, which is then placed back in the set of holes.
If the new hole is adjacent to other holes, these adjacent holes are merged to 
form one larger hole. This procedure is a particular instance of the general
dynamic storage-allocation problem, which concerns how to satisfy a request of
size \(n\) from a list of free holes. There are many solutions to this problem.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First fit</strong>: Allocate the first hole that is big enough. Searching can start
either at the beginning of the set of holes or at the location where the previous
first-fit search ended. We can stop searching as soon as we find a free hole that
is large enough.</li>
<li><strong>Best fit</strong>: Allocate the smallest hole that is big enough. We must search
the entire list, unless the list is ordered by size. This strategy produces the
smallest leftover hole.</li>
<li><strong>Worst fit</strong>: Allocate the largest hole. Again, we must search the entire list,
unless it is sorted by size. This strategy produces the largest leftover hole,
which may be more useful than the smaller leftover hole from a best-fit approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>Simulations have shown that both first fit and best fit are better than worst 
fit in terms of decreasing time and storage utilization. Neither first fit nor 
best fit is clearly better than the other in terms of storage utilization, but 
first fit is generally faster.</p>
<h2 id="fragmentation"><a class="header" href="#fragmentation">Fragmentation</a></h2>
<p>Both the first-fit and best-fit strategies for memory allocation suffer from
external fragmentation. As processes are loaded and removed from memory, the
free memory space is broken into little pieces. External fragmentation exists
when there is enough total memory space to satisfy a request but the available
spaces are not contiguous.</p>
<p>Depending on the total amount of memory storage and the average process size,
external fragmentation may be a minor or a major problem. Statistical analysis
of first fit, for instance, reveals that, even with some optimisation, given \(N\)
allocated blocks, another 0.5 \(N\) blocks will be lost to fragmentation.
That is, one third of memory may be unusable. This property is known as the
50-percent rule.</p>
<p>Memory fragmentation can be internal as well as external. Consider a multiple-partition 
allocation scheme with a hole of 18,464 bytes. Suppose that the next process 
requests 18,462 bytes. If we allocate exactly the requested block, we are left 
with a hole of 2 bytes. The overhead to keep track of this hole will be substantially 
larger than the hole itself. The general approach to avoiding this problem is 
to break the physical memory into fixed-sized blocks and allocate memory in units 
based on block size. With this approach, the memory allocated to a process may 
be slightly larger than the requested memory. The difference between these two 
numbers is internal fragmentation — unused memory that is internal to a partition.</p>
<p>One solution to the problem of external fragmentation is compaction. The goal
is to shuffle the memory contents so as to place all free memory together in one
large block. Compaction is not always possible, however. If relocation is static
and is done at assembly or load time, compaction cannot be done. It is possible
only if relocation is dynamic and is done at execution time.</p>
<h2 id="paging"><a class="header" href="#paging">Paging</a></h2>
<p>Paging is a memory-management scheme that permits a process's physical address
space to be non-contiguous. Paging avoids external fragmentation and the associated
need for compaction.</p>
<p>The basic method for implementing paging involves breaking physical memory into
fixed-sized blocks called frames and breaking logical memory into blocks of the
same size called pages. When a process is to be executed, its pages are loaded 
into any available memory frames from their source. The backing store is divided
into fized-sized blocks that are the same size as the memory frames or clusters
of multiple frames. For example, the logical address space is now totally separate
from the physical address space, so a process can have a logical 64-bit address
space even though the system has less than \(2^{64}\) bytes of physical memory.</p>
<p>Every address generated by the CPU is divided into two parts: a page numbeer (p)
and a page offset (d). The page number is used as an index into a pre-process
page table. The page table contains the base address of each frame in physical
memory, and the offset is the location in the frame being referenced. Thus the
base address of the frame is combined with the page offset to define the physical
memory address.</p>
<p>The use of registers for the page table is satisfactory if the page table is reasonably 
small (for example, 256 entries). Most contemporary CPUs, however, support much 
larger page tables (for example, 220 entries). For these machines, the use of 
fast registers to implement the page table is not feasible. Rather, the page table 
is kept in main memory, and a page-table base register (PTBR) points to the page 
table. Changing page tables requires changing only this one register, substantially 
reducing context-switch time.</p>
<p>Although storing the page table in main memory can yield faster context switches, 
it may also result in slower memory access times. Suppose we want to access location 
\(i\). We must first index into the page table, using the value in the PTBR 
offset by the page number for \(i\). This task requires one memory access. It 
provides us with the frame number, which is combined with the page offset to 
produce the actual address. We can then access the desired place in memory. With 
this scheme, two memory accesses are needed to access data (one for the page-table 
entry and one for the actual data). Thus, memory access is slowed by a factor 
of 2, a delay that is considered intolerable under most circumstances.</p>
<p>The standard solution to this problem is to use a special, small, fast-lookup 
hardware cache called a translation look-aside buffer (TLB). To be able to execute 
the search within a pipeline step, however, the TLB must be kept small. It is 
typically between 32 and 1,024 entries in size. Some CPUs implement separate 
instruction and data address TLBs. That can double the number of TLB entries 
available, because those lookups occur in different pipeline steps.</p>
<p>If the page number is not in the TLB (known as a TLB miss), address translation 
proceeds, where a memory reference to the page table must be made. When the frame 
number is obtained, we can use it to access memory. In addition, we add the page 
number and frame number to the TLB, so that they will be found quickly on the 
next reference.</p>
<p>Some TLBs store address-space identifier (ASIDs) in each TLB entry. An ASID uniquely 
identifies each process and is used to provide address-space protection for that 
process. When the TLB attempts to resolve virtual page numbers, it ensures that 
the ASID for the currently running process matches the ASID associated with the 
virtual page. If the ASIDs do not match, the attempt is treated as a TLB miss. 
In addition to providing address-space protection, an ASID allows the TLB to contain 
entries for several different processes simultaneously. If the TLB does not support 
separate ASIDs, then every time a new page table is selected (for instance, with 
each context switch), the TLB must be flushed (or erased) to ensure that the next 
executing process does not use the wrong translation information. Otherwise, the 
TLB could include old entries that contain valid virtual addresses but have 
incorrect or invalid physical addresses left over from the previous process.</p>
<p>The percentage of times that the page number of interest is found in the TLB is 
called the hit ratio. An 80-percent hit ratio, for example, means that we find 
the desired page number in the TLB 80 percent of the time. If it takes 10 nanoseconds 
to access memory, then a mapped-memory access takes 10 nanoseconds when the page 
number is in the TLB. If we fail to find the page number in the TLB then we must 
first access memory for the page table and frame number (10 nanoseconds) and then 
access the desired byte in memory (10 nanoseconds), for a total of 20 nanoseconds. 
(We are assuming that a pagetable lookup takes only one memory access, but it can 
take more, as we shall see.) </p>
<p>To find the effective memory-access time, we weight the case by its probability:</p>
<p>\[
\begin{align*}
\text{effective access time} &amp;= 0.80 \times 10 + 0.20 \times 20 \\
&amp;= 12 \text{nanoseconds}
\end{align*}
\]</p>
<p>In this example, we suffer a 20-percent slowdown in average memory-access time 
(from 10 to 12 nanoseconds).</p>
<h2 id="memory-protection"><a class="header" href="#memory-protection">Memory Protection</a></h2>
<p>Memory protection in a paged environment is accomplished by protection bits associated
with each frame. Normally, these bits are kept in the page table. One bit can
define a page to be read - write or read-only. Every reference to memory goes
through the page table to find the correct frame number. At the same time that
physical address is being computed, the protection bits can be checked to verify 
that no writes are being made to a read-only page. At attempt to write to a read-only
page causes a hardware trap to the operating system (or memory-protection violation).</p>
<p>One additional bit is generally attached to each entry in the page table: a valid-invalid
bit. When this bit is set to valid, the associated page is in the process's logical
address space and is thus a legal (or valid) page. When the bit is set to invalid, 
the page is not in the process's logical address space. Illegal addresses are trapped
by use of the valid-invalid bit. The operating system sets this bit for each page
to allow or disallow access to the page.</p>
<p>Rarely does a process use all its address range. In fact, many processes use only
a small fraction of the address space available to them. It would be wasteful in
these cases to create a page table with entries for every page in the address range.
Most of this table would be unused but would take up valuable memory space. Some
systems provide hardware, in the form of a page-table length register (PTLR), to
indicate the size of the page table. This value is checked against every logical 
address to verify that the address is in the valid range for the process. Failure
of this test causes an error trap to the operating system.</p>
<h2 id="shared-pages"><a class="header" href="#shared-pages">Shared Pages</a></h2>
<p>An advantage of paging is the possibility of sharing common code, a consideration
that is particularly important in an environment with multiple processes. On a 
typical Linux system, most user processes require the standard C library libc. 
One option is to have each process load its own copy of libc into its address space. 
If a system has 40 user processes, and the libc library is 2 MB, this would require 
80 MB of memory.</p>
<p>If the code is reentrant code, however, it can be shared.</p>
<p><img src="../media/sharing-in-paging-env.png" alt="Figure: Sharing of standard C library in a paging environment." /><br />
<strong>Figure: Sharing of standard C library in a paging environment.</strong></p>
<p>Here, we see three processes sharing the pages for the standard C library libc. 
Reentrant code is non-self-modifying code: it never changes during execution. 
Thus, two or more processes can execute the same code at the same time. Each process 
has its own copy of registers and data storage to hold the data for the process’s 
execution. The data for two different processes will, of course, be different. 
Only one copy of the standard C library need be kept in physical memory, and the 
page table for each user process maps onto the same physical copy of libc. Thus, 
to support 40 processes, we need only one copy of the library, and the total space 
now required is 2 MB instead of 80 MB — a significant saving. In addition to run-time 
libraries such as libc, other heavily used programs can also be shared — compilers, 
window systems, database systems, and so on.</p>
<h2 id="hierarchical-page-tables"><a class="header" href="#hierarchical-page-tables">Hierarchical Page Tables</a></h2>
<p>Most modern computer systems support a large logical address space (232 to 264). 
In such an environment, the page table itself becomes excessively large.
Clearly, we would not want to allocate the page table contiguously in main memory. 
One simple solution to this problem is to divide the page table into smaller pieces.</p>
<p>One way of accomplishing this division is to use a two-level paging algorithm,
in which the page table itself is also pages.</p>
<p><img src="../media/two-level-page-table-scheme.png" alt="Figure: A two-level page-table scheme." /><br />
<strong>Figure: A two-level page-table scheme.</strong></p>
<h2 id="hashed-page-tables"><a class="header" href="#hashed-page-tables">Hashed Page Tables</a></h2>
<p>One approach for handling address spaces larger than 32 bits is to use a hashed 
page table, with the hash value being the virtual page number. Each entry in the 
hash table contains a linked list of elements that hash to the same location 
(to handle collisions). Each element consists of three fields: (1) the virtual 
page number, (2) the value of the mapped page frame, and (3) a pointer to the 
next element in the linked list.</p>
<p>A variation of this scheme that is useful for 64-bit address spaces has been proposed. 
This variation uses clustered page tables, which are similar to hashed page tables 
except that each entry in the hash table refers to several pages (such as 16) 
rather than a single page. Therefore, a single page-table entry can store the 
mappings for multiple physical-page frames. Clustered page tables are particularly 
useful for sparse address spaces, where memory references are noncontiguous and 
scattered throughout the address space.</p>
<h2 id="inverted-page-tables"><a class="header" href="#inverted-page-tables">Inverted Page Tables</a></h2>
<p>An inverted page table has one entry for each real page (or frame) of memory. 
Each entry consists of the virtual address of the page stored in that real memory 
location, with information about the process that owns the page. Thus, only one 
page table is in the system, and it has only one entry for each page of physical 
memory.</p>
<h2 id="swapping"><a class="header" href="#swapping">Swapping</a></h2>
<p>Process instructions and the data they operate on must be in memory to be executed. 
However, a process, or a portion of a process, can be swapped temporarily out of 
memory to a backing store and then brought back into memory for continued execution. 
Swapping makes it possible for the total physical address space of all processes 
to exceed the real physical memory of the system, thus increasing the degree of 
multiprogramming in a system.</p>
